Hey there! I'm a 19-year-old undergrad diving into the world of STEM. Currently, I'm captivated by math, especially logic, categories, and foundation of math. I'm also eager to explore physics and statistics in near future. Beyond these, you can find me lost in poems and music, penning verses, or immersed in history and litreature.

This blog is about my journey navigating through the intrigruing landscape of STEM. Join me as I share my experiences, challenges, and discoveries along the way!
